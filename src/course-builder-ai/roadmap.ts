      prompt: `Create a comprehensive learning roadmap for "${topic}" at ${difficulty} level that can be used to generate a mindmap.

The roadmap should:
- Be structured as a hierarchical tree with branching topics
- Have multiple main branches (root topics) that can be learned in parallel
- Each topic can have multiple subtopics that branch out from it
- Topics at the same level can be learned simultaneously or in any order
- Include clear parent-child relationships between topics
- Provide clear summaries for each topic explaining what will be learned and why it's important
- Be appropriate for ${difficulty} level learners
- Use unique IDs for each topic and maintain parent-child relationships

Structure it like a mindmap where:
- Level 0: Core foundational concepts (2-4 root topics) - these should have NO parentId (leave it undefined or null)
- Level 1: Main learning areas that branch from foundations (3-6 topics per branch)
- Level 2: Specific skills/concepts within each area (2-4 topics per branch)
- Level 3+: Advanced/specialized topics as needed

CRITICAL RULES:
- Root topics (level 0) must have parentId as null or undefined (do NOT use empty string "")
- Only non-root topics should have a valid parentId that references their parent topic's ID
- The rootTopics array must contain the exact IDs of all level 0 topics
- Each topic must have a children array listing the IDs of its direct children
- Ensure parent-child relationships are consistent (if A is parent of B, then B's parentId should be A's id)

Example structure:
- Topic with level 0: { "id": "TOPIC-001", "level": 0, "parentId": null, "children": ["TOPIC-101", "TOPIC-102"] }
- Topic with level 1: { "id": "TOPIC-101", "level": 1, "parentId": "TOPIC-001", "children": ["TOPIC-111"] }

Return the topics as an array where each topic has a unique ID and proper parent-child relationships.`,
